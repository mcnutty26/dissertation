	\section*{Term 1}
	\subsection*{Weeks one and two}
	\subsection*{Weeks three and four}
	The coursework for the compiler design module took up more time than expected during these weeks, and as such the project was delayed. While the core application files were produced, no work was done on the content delivery. Features developed: login, database access, user object.
	\subsection*{Weeks five and six}
	Having completed the compiler design coursework early in week five, I was able to better apply myself to the project. By the end of week six, content delivery and analytics were done, putting the project back on track with the timeline set forth in the specification. After seeking clarification from my supervisor it has been determined that the software itself is more of a vehicle to allow experimentation with gamification, rather than an end in itself. Because of this, the focus is very much on rapid application development than rigid adherence to robust programming techniques and specification adherence. Features developed: database structure, content creation, content delivery, analytics tracking.
