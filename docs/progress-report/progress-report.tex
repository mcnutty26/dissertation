\section*{Introduction}
The project aims to explore how gamification and analytics can be used in the design of educational software. Gamification is a fairly young field of study, the term having only really gained popularity in late 2010 as shown in figure \ref{usage} (Google 2014).

In addition to the study of gamification, the project also seeks to provide an example of how analytics can be used to support lecturers and allow them to better use their time when teaching in a higher education context. This will be achieved by suggesting topics and delivery methods for guided one to one or seminar style tuition in an attempt to reinforce the progress made by students online. It will also be possible to match students who share learning styles and strength/weakness pairings in specific subject areas.

Construction of a web platform capable of the aforementioned functionality is a daunting undertaking, and the research required for it to be effective in it's aims will be substantial. Taking on a project in an exciting and relatively new field is proving to be both stimulating and rewarding.

\section*{Background Research}
Before the start of term I took a MOOC entitled gamification design (Iversity, 2014), which ran over several months and included a vast array of references and resources. In addition to this, a number of other sources of information have been identified. Of particular note are those concerned with gamification in the context of higher education (Nicholson, S., 2013) (Niman, N., 2014) given that it would appear that comparatively less work has been done in this sector of the education system.


\section*{Technical content}
Over the past eight weeks, work has been progressing largely according to the time line set forth in the specification. The core of the platform has been completed, including 
\section*{Progress}
I realised fairly early into the term that the timetable I had submitted as part of the specification was a bit more demanding than was necessary. While it achieved its objective in that it encouraged me to work hard from the start of the project, I am currently a week behind schedule after not having enough time available to complete all the work I had hoped to. In terms of the core of the application - the components required to facilitate the gamification features - development has finished, and these features are ready to use. This will allow me to begin researching and developing the areas that are linked to each Bartle personality type. A brief explanation of these personality types is given in appendix I. The web platform uses a database to store course content as well as the relationship between elements of the system, as shown in figure \ref{db}.

\section*{Next Steps}
\section*{Appraisal}
There was an error in the original timetable submitted in that the time set aside for writing this report was scheduled for after the due date. This, in addition to the scheduling issue mentioned above, has been rectified in a revised timetable contained in appendix II.
\section*{Ethics}
As described in appendix I, ethical consent will have to be obtained for the user feedback testing planned for week five of term two. This approval still needs to be sought. However, as the activities proposed are eligible for devolved consent this will not take long, and will be completed by the beginning of term two.
